# Growth Analysis for Hawksbill Sea Turtles  in Anegada, British Virgin Islands

## Introduction

The hawksbill sea turtle is a Critically Endangered sea turtle. In order to know the situation of wild hawksbill sea turtle, ecologist collect the data from Anegada. In this project, I will visualize the growth data (size, weight  etc.) of hawksbill sea turtle in Anegada.
My driving question(s) for this project include: 
(Some questions may not be answered based on the data)

* Does wild hawksbill  sea  turtles  have  high growth rate?
* How is the growth rate of wild hawksbill  sea  turtles compare to these in captivity and other turtles?

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed

**NOTE**: *Everything you write must be in your own words and with proper attribution of ideas to original sources.  Failing to do so constitutes plagairism.* 

### Goals of original study that produced the data are to estimate growth rate of juvenile hawksbill turtles around Anegada and to show the role of shallow water reef systems play in hawksbill turtles' growth. 

### Researchers use the rodeo technique to capture hawksbill turtles within the vicinity of reefs. They tag these turtles, measure the size of them (cm), and weight them (kg). 

### Comma separated values file (.csv)

#### This data set include: 
Date(char), ID(char), CCLnt(numerical), SCL(numerical), Weight(numerical), Water Column Depth(numerical), Easting(numerical), Northing(numerical)

#### Size of data (i.e., megabytes, lines, etc.)
17.31KB
390 lines (include one heading line)

#### There are some NA (R may read as NA or char)

## Detailed Description of Analysis to be Done and Challenges Involved

1. Import data into R
2. Calculate the growth rate for each hawksbill turtle
3. Analyze the growth rate and figure out the general growth rate
4. Visualize data according to size and weight
5. Visualize the comparison between wild hawksbill turtle and these in captivity
6. Visualize the comparison between hawksbill turtle and other turtles
7. Plot capture point on map if possible
